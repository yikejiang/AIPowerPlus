# AI Power Plus

AI Power Plus does not contain any API key, but it makes you easily utilize the API of OpenAI, Claude AI or Google Gemini.

Originally I wrote the software for my personal use. But I became aware that many people might need such a tool to utilize APIs of AI models, I decided to release it.

## How to run the program

When you run the source code through Python, you just need to install PySide6.

The executable program created through PyInstaller is downloadable. An installer is also provided and it will create a shortcut in the Start menu of Windows.
